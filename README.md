This is a Tasks GUI program having ML functionalities. Just fork and run it.
1.) The punishment will turn on your webcam or camera to perform the pushups or squats
2.) If you have a task that is long due (you skipped or forgot the task). Then the program counts how many tasks you didn't do and appends calculates the punishments accordingly
3.) You have to change the status of the tasks to 'Done' after you have done them, or they will be counted into punishments the next day.
4.) The punishment will not reset to 0 until you complete the punishment (it will forever haunt you until you do it).
5.) The Data is stored in a postgres database deployed in an online cloud.
